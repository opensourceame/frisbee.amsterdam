At the 26th and 27th of May 2018 our second edition of the Natte Neuzen tournament, a loose-mixed (7 vs 7, with 2 or 3 woman on the line) outdoor tournament, will be held in Wageningen!

If you are looking for a team to play on, the Frisbee Amsterdam group is fielding
a team (_Wicked Discs of the West_) and we have a few open slots. For details, get
in touch on slack.
